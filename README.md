## Python Nuclear Ensemble Approach for Linear Electronic Spectroscopy (PyNEAppLES)

### About
This repository contains several tools for electronic spectra simulations using the nuclear ensemble approach/method (NEA/NEM). Look into references [1] and [2] for the general description of the NEA. The calculation of error bars is described in ref. [2]. This repository also includes a program for so-called representative sampling (see ref. [3]) allowing to select a small number of geometries representing the initial state density by employing a fast exploratory method. Representative sampling can be used to speed up spectra simulations by reducing the number of expensive high-level calculations.
